              During my most recent co-op, I implemented features in multiple back-end applications
              in <b>Go</b>. I was responsible for testing my own code through writing
              unit and end-to-end tests. One of my most relevant work involves implementing 
              GDPR regulations into our legacy code which resulted in an increase
              of 300,000 bid requests processed and anonymized per week. I also worked on
              front-end tasks in <b>React</b> and <b>Angular</b>and gained experience using
               <b>Docker</b> and <b>Ansible</b>.

              In my second co-op, I helped solve problems for internal
              employees. Our tech stack for our web apps are:
              <b> React, Node, Express, SQL</b>. My coworkers called me a{" "}
              <b>"front-end expert"</b> -- I definitely do not consider myself
              an expert ðŸ˜‹ but my greatest strengths in the team were my
              front-end knowledge and problem solving skills. Therefore, I took
              on many projects that involved designing features to solve a
              painpoint and programming the features before delivering my work
              to the users to test and receive feedback.

              favourite project is{" "}
              <b>designing and coding the current website homepage</b>. During
              my interview with the company, I critiqued the website as lacking
              in user experience which lead me to take on this project. This was
              challenging yet very enjoyable as it was my first time designing a
              complete website and coding it in <b>JavaScript, HTML/CSS, PHP</b>
              . I also developed a go-to marketing plan and advertising campaign
              for Syngli in addition to fixing bugs on the website.
